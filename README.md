#Cheatsheet from anything that I know yet from learning how to code and become a programmer.
######Author: Blanka Witczak
##Status: _in progress_.

##About this project
**This project is bilingual which means some things are written in English or Polish, for example (from FAQhtml):**
```<select name="animals">
          <option value="cat">Kot</option>
          <option value="dog">Pies</option>
          <option value="seal">Foka</option>
          <option value="hamster">Chomik</option>
        </select>```

**Please keep in mind that I'm learning from courses and other sources and I'm writing down what I learned. It's not a form of teaching and I'm not describing everything in full phrases or examples (which may change in future).**

I wanted to create something exactly like a cheatsheet because
*My memory could never remember all of those tiny details
*I don't want to spend half of time during any work searching for "how did it go.."
*You may learn something new from here or this could be usefull as a reminder, don't be shy, share some :)
*My perfectionism requires notes that are easy to use and look nice - can't deal with it
*Wouldn't it be nice few years from now to take a look and see how much did I learn?

Plans about this project? I have no idea yet except for learning more and helping others.
