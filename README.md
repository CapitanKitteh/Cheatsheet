# Cheatsheet from anything that I know yet from learning how to code and become a programmer.

###### Author: Blanka Witczak

Status: _in progress_.


## About this project

**This project is bilingual which means some things are written in English or Polish, for example (from FAQhtml):**

        <select name="animals">
      
         <option value="cat">Kot</option>

         <option value="dog">Pies</option>

         <option value="seal">Foka</option>

         <option value="hamster">Chomik</option>

        </select>

**Please keep in mind that I'm learning from courses and other sources and I'm writing down what I've learned.
It's not a form of teaching and I'm not describing everything in full phrases or examples (which may change in future).**

For now, learning plan include Frontend Web Development, but for sure you can find more informations about many different things here in future, so keep watching :)


I wanted to create something exactly like a cheatsheet because

* My memory could never remember all of those tiny details

* I don't want to spend half of time during any work searching for "how did it go.."

* Just like me, you're new to this and wonder how to document what you will learn?

* You may learn something new from here or this could be usefull as a reminder, don't be shy, share some :)

* My perfectionism requires notes that are easy to use and look nice - can't deal with it

* Wouldn't it be nice few years from now to take a look and see how much did I learn?

Plans about this project? To learn and make my dreams come true. 
It takes time to learn, but new knowlege and changes are going to be added immediately to this project.

I'd like this project to become more professional at some point, and I'll try to use the knowlege here included to make this project even better.
